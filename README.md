# Othernet-server-reader
New version of HTML data reader/server for Othernet Dreamcatcher board.
Read Help file in "otherhtm.zip", unzip to secondary FAT32 SD memory card.
Right clicking a sub frame and selcting the back arrow on the top left will reactivate file selector or use back arrrow on keyboard.
With a large number of news/message files to sync sub frames will take time to become active.
Have fun and feel free to make changes, keep in touch on the Othernet forum.
